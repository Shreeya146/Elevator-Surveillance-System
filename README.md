## 📌 Project Overview  
The *Smart Elevator Surveillance System* is an *IoT-enabled real-time monitoring solution* for elevator safety.  
It detects *cable faults, abnormal vibrations, current/voltage anomalies, and immediately notifies building management through **Email/SMS alerts*.  

This system enhances *safety, reduces downtime, lowers maintenance costs, and enables predictive maintenance* – making it ideal for smart buildings and Industry 4.0 adoption.

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Real-time monitoring of *vibration, voltage, and current*  
- ✅ *Abnormal fault detection* (open/short circuits, insulation breakdown, mechanical imbalance)  
- ✅ *IoT-enabled alerts* via Blynk, Email, and SMS  
- ✅ *Compact & low-cost design* (ESP32 + sensors)  
- ✅ Easy integration into existing elevator control systems  
- ✅ Future-ready: *AI/ML-based predictive maintenance* support
